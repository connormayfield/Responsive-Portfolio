# Responsive-Portfolio

I ran out of time - wasn't able to get to coding the mobile size media query.

I worked off of the slacked out solution for homework 1 so if there are some extra files from that and it's hard to look through i'm sorry. 

I made a CSS file that corresponds with each html file so it wouldn't be messy.
